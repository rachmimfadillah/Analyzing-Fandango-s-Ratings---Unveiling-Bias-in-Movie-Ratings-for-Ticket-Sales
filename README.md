# Analyzing-Fandango-s-Ratings---Unveiling-Bias-in-Movie-Ratings-for-Ticket-Sales
This data analysis project examines the trustworthiness of online movie ratings, particularly focusing on Fandango. The goal is to investigate whether Fandango's ratings in 2015 were influenced by a bias towards higher ratings, potentially driven by their ticket sales interests. Using pandas and visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover any patterns suggesting a bias and determine if Fandango's ratings were inflated to boost ticket sales.
